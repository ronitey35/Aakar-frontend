# üåç **CSS Positioning**

CSS positioning controls how elements are placed on a webpage. It determines the position of elements relative to other elements or the viewport using properties like `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. There are five main positioning types, each with unique behaviors and uses:

### **Types of CSS Positioning**

---

### 1. üü¢ **Static Positioning** *(Default)*

- **Description**: The default behavior for elements in CSS. Elements follow the normal document flow.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Elements appear in the order they are written in the HTML.
  - No movement with `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`.
  - Elements stack vertically without overlapping.

---

### 2. üü° **Relative Positioning**

- **Description**: Positions an element relative to its original position in the document.
- **Characteristics**:
  - The element retains its space in the flow.
  - Can be moved using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.
  - Surrounding elements are not affected by the move.

### 3. üîµ **Absolute Positioning**

- **Description**: Removes the element from the document flow and places it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
- **Characteristics**:
  - The element is no longer in the document flow.
  - Can overlap other elements.
  - Positioned relative to the nearest ancestor with a `position` other than `static`.

---

### 4. üü£ **Fixed Positioning**

- **Description**: Fixes the element relative to the viewport. It remains visible even when the page is scrolled.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Useful for elements like headers or footers that should always be visible.
  - Does not leave a gap where the element would normally be in the flow.

---

### 5. üü§ **Sticky Positioning**

Description**: A hybrid between relative and fixed positioning. The element behaves like a `relative` element until a defined scroll position is reached, at which point it becomes `fixed`.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Useful for navigation bars or elements that should remain visible after scrolling past them.
